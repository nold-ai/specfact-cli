# Change Validation: ai-integration-03-instruction-files

- **Validated on (UTC):** 2026-02-15T21:54:26Z
- **Workflow:** /wf-validate-change (proposal-stage dry-run validation)
- **Strict command:** `openspec validate ai-integration-03-instruction-files --strict`
- **Result:** PASS

## Scope Summary

- **New capabilities:** cross-platform-instructions
- **Modified capabilities:** (none)
- **Declared dependencies:** ai-integration-01 (Agent Skill — instruction files reference skill content)
- **Proposed affected code paths:** - `modules/ide/src/` (extend with instruction file generation);- Instruction template files

## Breaking-Change Analysis (Dry-Run)

- Interface changes are proposal-level only; no production code modifications were performed in this workflow stage.
- Proposed modified capabilities are additive/extension-oriented in the current spec deltas and do not require immediate breaking migrations at proposal time.
- Backward-compatibility risk is primarily sequencing-related (dependency ordering), not signature-level breakage at this stage.

## Dependency and Integration Review

- Dependency declarations align with the 2026-02-15 architecture layer integration plan sequencing.
- Cross-change integration points are explicitly represented in proposal/spec/task artifacts.
- No additional mandatory scope expansion was required to pass strict OpenSpec validation.

## Validation Outcome

- Required artifacts are present: `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `specs/**/*.md`, `tasks.md`.
- Strict OpenSpec validation passed.
- Change is ready for implementation-phase intake once prerequisites are satisfied.
