# SpecFact CLI License FAQ

This FAQ explains the Sustainable Use License and what you can and cannot do with SpecFact CLI.

## What license does SpecFact CLI use?

SpecFact CLI uses the **Sustainable Use License**, a fair-code license that allows free use for internal business purposes while protecting against commercial exploitation.

## What is the Sustainable Use License?

The Sustainable Use License is a license that:

- **Allows free use** for internal business purposes and non-commercial use
- **Restricts commercial use** to prevent SaaS clones and commercial exploitation
- **Protects the project** while encouraging adoption and contribution
- **Uses plain English** to be clear about what's allowed

## What is and isn't allowed under the license?

### ✅ **ALLOWED** - You can

- **Use SpecFact CLI internally** for your own business automation
- **Modify the code** for your internal use
- **Create AI agents** for your own company's workflows
- **Provide consulting services** around SpecFact CLI (building workflows, custom features)
- **Support and maintain** SpecFact CLI installations for clients
- **Use for academic research** and non-commercial projects
- **Contribute code** to the project (subject to CLA)

### ❌ **NOT ALLOWED** - You cannot

- **Sell SpecFact CLI as a service** (SaaS hosting)
- **White-label SpecFact CLI** and offer it to customers for money
- **Use SpecFact CLI to collect customer credentials** for commercial services
- **Create competing AI agent platforms** based on SpecFact CLI
- **Distribute modified versions** for commercial purposes

## Can I use SpecFact CLI to power features in my commercial app?

**It depends on how you use it:**

### ✅ **ALLOWED** - Using company credentials

**Example**: Your company uses SpecFact CLI to automate internal processes using your own API keys and credentials.

### ❌ **NOT ALLOWED** - Collecting customer credentials

**Example**: You use SpecFact CLI to collect your customers' API keys and credentials to provide them with automation services.

## What if I want to use SpecFact CLI commercially?

If you need to use SpecFact CLI for commercial purposes beyond what's allowed by the Sustainable Use License, you need an **Enterprise License**. This includes:

- **SaaS or hosted deployments**
- **Commercial AI agent services**
- **Enterprise internal use at scale**
- **White-label solutions**

Contact us at **[hello@noldai.com](mailto:hello@noldai.com)** for enterprise licensing.

## Why not use an open source license?

SpecFact CLI's mission is to democratize AI agent automation while building a sustainable business. The Sustainable Use License:

- **Makes the software widely available** for legitimate use
- **Protects against commercial exploitation** that would harm the project
- **Enables sustainable development** and long-term support
- **Balances openness with business viability**

## What is fair-code?

Fair-code is a software model where:

- Software is **free to use** and can be distributed
- **Source code is openly available**
- Software can be **extended by the community**
- **Commercial use is restricted** by the authors

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code license.

3. **Your contributions can be used** in any version of SpecFact CLI
