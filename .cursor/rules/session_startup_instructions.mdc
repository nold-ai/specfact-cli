# Session Startup Instructions

## Core Workflow Reminders

- **Testing:** Run `hatch run smart-test`. Ensure total coverage is >= 80%.
- **Formatting:** Apply `black .`, `isort .`, `mypy .`, and `pylint src tests` before committing.
- **Commits:** Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.
- **Versioning:** When releasing, update `CHANGELOG.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, and `src/__init__.py`.
- **Docstrings:** Follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
